The data folder necessary to run these codes can be asked on demand at maturin.simonneau@ensta.fr. It will be transferred by wetransfer in a zipped version.
Once you have it, just unzipp the content and put it at the root of the copied repository.
You also need to have access to Ifremer DATARMOR to allow these code to work properly - they point towards datarmor to get some data.
