The data folder necessary to run these codes can be found at this DATARMOR address:

/scale/project/siam/project/swot/wave-current-study/Codes_PFE_Maturin

Just copy and paste the directories "data", "fonts", "output_images", "B_df" and "G_df" at the root of your working directory (i.e. where you put the notebooks from this git), and everything should work.
